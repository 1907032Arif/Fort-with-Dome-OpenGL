# Fort with Dome OpenGL 

This project showcases a visually engaging scene of a 3D Missile System created using Modern OpenGL (3.3). Leveraging the power of shaders, vertex buffers, and textures, the implementation brings to life a dynamic and immersive representation of a bustling railway environment.

This project includes implementation on:
- Vertex Shader and Fragment Shader
- Lighting (Point Light, Directional Light, Spot Light)
- Texture
- BÃ©zier curve
